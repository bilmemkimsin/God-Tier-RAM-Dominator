# Injector / Agent

This folder hosts optional deep‑access components:

- **DLL Agent**: for internal hooks, function interception, and telemetry.
- **Manual Mapper**: load unsigned DLLs without touching the loader list.
- **Driver (Optional)**: kernel‑level access for protected targets.

These components are **not enabled by default** and are intentionally left as stubs in this repository to keep the educational focus and legal boundaries clear.
